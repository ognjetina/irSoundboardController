# irSoundboardController

irSoundboardController is an Arduino project communicating with [qLab](https://figure53.com/qlab/) app by sending MIDI notes using [hairless midi serial](http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/) to MIDI bridge.
## Purpose


I am using an Arduino board with IR sensor connected to my mac while streaming for playing various sounds by IR remote.

Arduino is detecting what button is pressed on the remote and is sending an MIDI note to hairless midi bridge that is passing it to qLab that is finally playing that sound.
